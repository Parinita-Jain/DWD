1. Measure of Central Tendency
Central tendency refers to the central or typical value in a dataset. It provides a summary of the dataset with a single value.

Mean: The arithmetic average of the data.
Median: The middle value when data is ordered.
Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.
2. Measure of Dispersion
Dispersion measures how spread out the data values are. It gives an idea of the variability or diversity in the dataset.

Range: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
Variance: Average of the squared differences from the mean.
Standard Deviation: Square root of the variance.
Interquartile Range (IQR): Difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and 25th percentile (Q1).
3. Measure of Association
Measures of association describe the strength and direction of relationships between two variables.

Correlation Coefficient (r): Measures the linear relationship between two variables. Ranges from 
−1 to +1.
Covariance: Measures the direction of the relationship between two variables (positive, negative, or no relationship).
Regression: Quantifies the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

4. Skewness
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution.

Positive Skew (Right-Skewed): Tail is longer on the right. Mean > Median > Mode.
Negative Skew (Left-Skewed): Tail is longer on the left. Mean < Median < Mode.
Symmetric: No skew, often resembles a normal distribution. Mean = Median = Mode.

5. Probability Basics
Probability quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring, ranging from 
0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
Event: A specific outcome or set of outcomes.
Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes.
Probability Formula:
P(E)= Total number of outcomes/Number of favorable outcomes

Q.> A bag contains 3 red balls, 4 green balls, and 5 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting:

(a) A red ball?
(b) A green ball?
(c) A blue ball?

Solution-- A bag contains 3 red balls, 4 green balls, and 5 blue balls. Total balls =3+4+5=12.

(a) Probability of selecting a red ball:
𝑃(Red)=Number of red balls/Total balls=3/12=0.25

(b) Probability of selecting a green ball:
𝑃(Green)=4/12=0.333

(c) Probability of selecting a blue ball:
𝑃(Blue)=5/12=0.417

#-----------------------------------------------------
There are variety of Distributions,they help us make probabilistic predictions and informed decisions under uncertainty.

Understanding Variability: They explain how data is spread and help compute probabilities for specific outcomes.

Foundation for Statistical Tests: Many statistical methods, including hypothesis testing and regression, 
rely on assumptions about underlying distributions.
​
#-----------------------------------------------------
6. Uniform Distribution
In a uniform distribution, all outcomes are equally likely.

Discrete Uniform Distribution: A finite number of equally likely outcomes.
Continuous Uniform Distribution: Every value in an interval is equally likely.
Example: Rolling a fair six-sided die.

Q.> A spinner is divided into 6 equal sections numbered from 1 to 6. If the spinner is spun once, what is the probability of:

(a) Landing on 4?
(b) Landing on an odd number?

#--------------------------------------------------------
7. Binomial Distribution
A binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, 
where each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure).

Key Parameters:
n: Number of trials.
p: Probability of success.
q=1−p: Probability of failure.
Probability Formula:

P(X=k)=nCk*p^k*(1-p)^(n-k)

k is the number of successes.

Q.>A coin is tossed 5 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads if the probability of getting heads in each toss is 
p=0.5?
A coin is tossed 5 times (𝑛=5,𝑝=0.5). Probability of exactly 3 heads:

P(X=3)=( 5C3)(0.5)^3*(1−0.5)^2 = 5!/(3!*(5-3)!)*(1/2)^3*(1/2)^2 = 10*0.03125 = 0.3125
 
#---------------------------------------------------------
8. Standard Normal Distribution
The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with:

Mean (μ) = 0,
Standard Deviation (σ) = 1.
It is a symmetric, bell-shaped curve, and probabilities are calculated using a Z-table. The formula for the 
Z-score is:
Z= X−μ/σ
​
This converts raw scores into standardized values for comparison.

Imagine that Jeremy took part in an examinaƟon. The test is having a
mean score of 160, and it has a standard deviaƟon of 15. If Jeremy's zscore is 1.20, what would be his score on the test? 

X=μ+Z⋅σ
X=160+(1.20⋅15)

X=160+18
X=178
Jeremy's Score:
Jeremy scored 178 on the test.
----
Jeremy scored 178 on the test is my assunption or hypothesis. I can be right or wrong. 
Term hypothesis forms the basis for testing claims about the data.
Hypothesis testing is the process of making decisions or 
inferences about a population based on sample data.

Sample --
1. Sampling Techniques
Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole population.

**Random Sampling
Definition: Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
Example: Selecting 50 students at random from a college of 5000 students by assigning random numbers.
Advantage: Minimizes bias and ensures each sample is representative of the population.

**Stratified Sampling
Definition: The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on shared characteristics, and random samples are taken from each stratum.
Example: A company wants to survey employees across departments. The workforce is divided into strata (e.g., IT, HR, Finance), and a random sample is selected from each department.
Advantage: Ensures representation of all subgroups, especially when subgroups differ significantly.
----
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method to make decisions about a population based on sample data.

Steps in Hypothesis Testing
Define Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (𝐻0): No effect or difference. Example: "The mean height of adults is 170 cm."
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Effect or difference exists. Example: "The mean height is not 170 cm."
Select Significance Level (α): Commonly α=0.05.
Choose a Test: Depends on data type and distribution (e.g., Z-test, t-test, chi-square test).
Calculate Test Statistic: Compare the sample data to H0.
Make a Decision:
Reject H0 - if the p-value<α.
Fail to reject H0 - if the p-value>α.

3. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution 
as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.

Key Points:
The mean of the sampling distribution equals the population mean (𝜇).
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (𝜎𝑥ˉ) is:
𝜎𝑥ˉ=σ/sqrt(n)
Works best for sample sizes 𝑛>30

Example:
If the population mean income is $50,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000, and you take a sample of 100 people:
Sampling distribution mean = $50,000.
Sampling distribution standard deviation:
𝜎𝑥ˉ=10,000/100 =1,000

4. Estimating Population Parameters
This involves using sample data to estimate population characteristics like mean (μ).

Point Estimation
A single value used to estimate a parameter.
Example: The sample mean (𝑥ˉ) estimates the population mean (μ).

Interval Estimation
Provides a range (confidence interval) within which the parameter is likely to lie.
Formula for confidence interval (mean):
CI=𝑥±𝑍⋅(𝜎/sqrt(𝑛))
Z: Critical value based on confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95%).
Example:
Sample mean weight = 70 kg, standard deviation = 5 kg, sample size = 50.
95% confidence interval:
CI=70±1.96⋅(5/sqrt(50)) =70±1.38=(68.62,71.38)
#------------------
5. P-values, Type 1 and Type 2 Errors
P-values
Definition: Probability of observing the sample results, or more extreme, assuming 𝐻0 is true.
Interpretation: P≤α: Reject (significant evidence against H0).
                P>α: Fail to reject H0
​
 .
Type 1 Error(α) : Rejecting H0 when it is actually true.
Example: Concluding a drug is effective when it’s not.

Type 2 Error (β) : Failing to reject H0 when it is actually false.
Example: Concluding a drug is not effective when it actually is.

Example:
Significance level (α=0.05), p-value = 0.03:
Since 0.03<0.05, reject H0
or p = 0.08 when (α=0.05). since, 0.08>0.05 -- accept H0
​
Type 1 Error: False rejection of H0 with 5% probability.
Type 2 Error: False acceptance of H0.

----
A Telecom service provider claims that individual customers pay on an
average 400 Rs. per month with standard deviaƟon of 25 rs. A random
sample of 50 customers bills during a given month is taken with a mean
of 250 and standard deviaƟon of 15. What to say with respect to the
claim made by the service provider? 


1. Define Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H0): The average bill is μ=400 Rs. (claim made by the provider).
Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻𝑎): The average bill is 𝜇≠400Rs. (the sample indicates a significant deviation from the claim).
This is a two-tailed test since we are checking for deviation in either direction.

2. Test Statistic Formula
We calculate the test statistic (Z) for the sample mean:
𝑍=(𝑋ˉ−𝜇)/𝜎/sqrt(𝑛)
Where:
𝑋ˉ=250 (sample mean),
μ=400 (population mean, claimed value),
σ=25 (population standard deviation),
n=50 (sample size).

3. Calculate the Test Statistic
Substitute the values:

𝑍=(250−400)/25/sqrt(50)≈−42.43

4. Interpret the Results
A Z-score of −42.43 is an extremely large magnitude, far beyond any typical critical value (e.g., 
Z = ±1.96 for a 95% confidence level). This indicates overwhelming evidence against the null hypothesis.

5. Conclusion
In this case, the null hypothesis (H0) is rejected.
The sample data strongly contradicts the telecom provider's claim that the average bill is 400 Rs. 
The mean bill of 250 Rs in the sample suggests that their claim is not accurate.
